Thanks for checking this out! First, you must download the "Dental Radiography" dataset that can be found on Kaggle.

To train and save your model, run the train_and_save.py file. Please note you will have to change the paths to you training folder and annotation file.

To test your model, run test.py. You will again need to specify the correct paths, this time for the saved model and testing dataset (and its annotations).
